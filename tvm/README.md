# TVM-VAI

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

The TVM-Vitis is a versatile flow that integrates the high-performance computing power of Xilinxâ€™s vitis AI engine with the flexibility of the TVM framework to accelerate models from any given framework supported by the TVM in a matter that is seamless to the end-user. 

### Tech

TVM-Vitis uses a number of projects as follows: 
* [Apache TVM] - An end-to-end deep learning compiler stack
* [Xilinx Vitis AI] - Xilinx development platform for AI inference
* [DPU] :  Xilinx Deep Learning Processor Unit (DPU)
* [Pynq-DPU] - DPU overlay for Pynq to run models compiled using TVM-Vitis flow on edge devices


### Installation
The TVM-Vitis provides an easy installation using Docker.
The repository provides scripts to build and run a docker image pre-setup for TVM-VAI. 

Simply clone the repositroy and use the build script to build an image. This step may take several moments.

```sh
$ cd tvm_release
$ bash ./build.sh ci_vai_11 bash
```
This creates an image based on Vitis-AI, pulls necessary dependencies, and builds the latest TVM-VAI compatible version of the Apache TVM.

### Development

Once finished builiding the image, run the docker image using the run script.
```sh
$ bash ./bash.sh tvm.ci_vai_11
```

##### Environment Setup
TVM-VAI docker image uses conda package management system. Use conda to setup your docker environment at login prior to running any examples.

```sh
$ conda activate vitis-ai-tensorflow
```

Verify the setup by importing the TVM-VAI packages in python3
```sh
$ python3
$ import tvm
$ import pyxir
```
